# 📃 Description of Ciphers
**Stream Ciphering** - is a method of encryption that involves applying a certain sequence (a key-generated stream) to the plaintext. Typically, this means adding the characters of the plaintext to the characters of the stream modulo the alphabet size.

**Vigenère Cipher** is a classic example of a stream cipher. In this cipher, alphabet characters are represented as elements of the set 𝑍𝑚, where 𝑚 is the alphabet size. The plaintext and ciphertext are denoted as 𝑥 = (𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑙) and 𝑦 = (𝑦1, … , 𝑦𝑙), where 𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖 ∈ 𝑍𝑚, 𝑖 = 1, 𝑙.

The encryption key is represented as a sequence of alphabet characters 𝑘 = (𝑘1, … , 𝑘𝑟), 𝑘𝑗 ∈ 𝑍𝑚, 𝑗 = 1, 𝑟, 𝑟 ≤ 𝑙, which is used to generate the stream 𝛾 = (𝛾1, … , 𝛾𝑟), 𝛾𝑖 ∈ 𝑍𝑚, 𝑖 = 1, 𝑟.

Encryption involves adding the characters of the plaintext to the characters of the stream modulo 𝑚: 𝑦𝑖 = (𝑥𝑖 + 𝛾𝑖) mod 𝑚. Decryption is performed by subtracting the stream characters from the ciphertext characters modulo 𝑚.

In the Vigenère cipher, a short phrase called the passphrase is usually used as the encryption key, which is cyclically repeated to form the stream.

Another approach to generating the key sequence is the **autokey Vigenère**. Here, only one symbol is chosen as the initial key, to which all characters of the plaintext are added, except the last one, to form the stream. The stream can also be generated by sequentially adding ciphertext characters to the initial symbol.
